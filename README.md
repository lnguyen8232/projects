# projects

This repository is where I publicize my personal projects. If you would like to use my project, please remember to credit me.

For R files, make sure in the .r or .rmd file, you change "setwd('C:/directory to .csv')" to set the working directory to where your .csv is. You can use "getwd()" to get your current directory to help you navigate.
