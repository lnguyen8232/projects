There are three files in a designated folder following the same name of the project (IMDb Video Games Data Analysis). First is the csv file or the data itself of IMDb Video Games. Second is the rmarkdown file (or .rmd) which requires an R editor, or better, an R IDE to view, execute, and/or knit the code. Third is the HTML which is the result of exporting the file to HTML, and it has been modified in a way that all codes were hidden except for statistical models and text so that it will be communicated to a general audience.
